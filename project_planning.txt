For the first development phase, we'll make a ship that can move right and left when the player presses
the arrow keys and fire bullets when the player presses the spacebar. After setting up this behavior,
we can create the aliens and refine the gameplay.

For the second development phase, we will add a full fleet of aliens to the top of the screen. 
Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet is shot down, an alien hits the ship,
or an alien reaches the ground. If an alien hits the ship or the ground, we'll destory teh ship and create
a new fleet. If the entire fleet is show down, we'll create a new fleet. 
Also, we will limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game when the player has 
used up the allotted number of ships.
